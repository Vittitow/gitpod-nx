## Details

- Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start the creation of a new Nx workspace

> **Heads up!**
> If you see "No matching choices", that's some bug in `create-nx-workspace` or it's me forcing it to behave in a way it wasn't supposed to. Either way, press "down arrow" and you'll see the choices.

- Once you're ready to push your first code changes, use the "Source Control" panel to save and sync your changes: VSCode and Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it

Or if you know how to do it, you can just create an empty repository on your favorite Git hosting provider, add the remote, and push.
